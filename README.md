In the current project the goal is to create an app that will help the user save contact information (this is a project in progress).

These are some commands important to remember:
-git status
-git add . ->Stages all changes in the current directory.
-git commit -m "" ->Record changes to the repository. When you make modifications to your files, you use this command to save those changes to the local repository.
-git push ->Upload local repository commits to a remote repository. Once you've committed your changes locally to send those commits to a shared repository
