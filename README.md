# Jimapp  
The current project's goal is to create an app that will help the user save contact information (this is a project in progress).  
  
These are some commands essential to remember:  
-git status  
-git add . ->Stages all changes in the current directory.  
-git commit -m "" ->Record changes to the repository. When you modify your files, you use this command to save those changes to the local repository.  
-git push ->Upload local repository commits to a remote repository. Once you've committed your changes locally, send those commits to a shared repository
